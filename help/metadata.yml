knownIssues: |
  AzureDevOps Services and some of the TFS Servers (default depends of the version), does not accept clear password for the **Basic** authentication method. You should [create a Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/pats?view=azdevops) and use it instead of a password.<br/>
  Uploading Attachments in the "Chunked" mode when using NTLM authentication via proxied connection may fail if proxy server closes connection after a POST request without a response content.
