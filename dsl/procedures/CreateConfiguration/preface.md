### Important
AzureDevOps Services and some of the TFS Servers (default depends of the version), does not accept clear password for the **Basic** authentication method. You should [create a Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/pats?view=azdevops) and use it instead of a password.\
<br/>
Custom API Version should be specified only if you are using TFS and your version is not listed.
